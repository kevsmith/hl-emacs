To use these files in your Emacs config drop the following two
lines in your .emacs file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "<path_to_checked_out_emacs_files>")
(require 'my_config)

Obviously, you'll need to replace <path_to_checked_out_emacs_files>
with the actual path to this code tree :)

Note: If you're using Aquamacs Emacs its version of .emacs is:

~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Eamcs/customizations
